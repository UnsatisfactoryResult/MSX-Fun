This is a very simple upgrade. All that's needed is the following:

2 x 41464-12 or similar ram chips. You can purchase them from here as of 4/3/24: https://www.jameco.com/z/41464-10-Major-Brands-IC-41464-10-DRAM-256K-Bit-64Kx4-100ns-w-Page-Mode-HY53C464S-10-_41574.html

2 x 0.1uF bypass caps for the memory

With these 4 items in hand you just need to install them in locations IC113, IC114, C122, and C123. Then move jumper J1102 from 1-3 to 1-2. I have provided some pictures for clarity.
