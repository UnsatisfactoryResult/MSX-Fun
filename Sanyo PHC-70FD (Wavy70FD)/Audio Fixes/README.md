SD-Snatcher has a fantastic site for MSX info, tools, and fixes. These audio fixes are taken from their site, I'm just following along and posting my own pictures. Please check out their site here: https://frs.badcoffee.info/hardware/MSXfixes.html

This is basically 2 modifications. 1 - we're putting the audio circuit back into spec, and 2 - we're lowing the noise on the audio output.

Use high quality metal film resistors and NP0/C0G/film capacitors. We're dealing with audio, so quality is important.
