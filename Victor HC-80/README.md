The Victor HC-80 is an MSX2 variant with a few interesting features. 

It has 3 video outputs: RF, composite from the 5 pin DIN labeled Monitor, and RGB via a JP21 connector.

THE JP21 CONNECTOR IS NOT THE SAME PINOUT AS SCART!

The firmware includes a cool synth program Tiny Synth. It also includes a graph program, yay... 

There's a reset button on the back that comes in handy. 

Unfortunately it also has a problematic design detail. It uses split RAM. The 32KB lives in slot 0-0, whiles the lower 32KB is in slot 0-2. Be aware that some software or products may not work properly or at all.
